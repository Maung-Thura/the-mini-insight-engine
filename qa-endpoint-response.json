        "answer": "To help with your trouble sleeping, you can try the following:\n\n1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock and can improve sleep quality over time [SLEEP_001].\n\n2. Turn your bedroom into a 'sleep sanctuary' by ensuring it is dark, cool, and quiet. A suitable environment signals to your body that it's time for restorative sleep [SLEEP_003].\n\n3. Create a technology curfew by avoiding screens (phones, tablets, TVs) for at least 60 minutes before bed. This helps prevent blue light from confusing your brain and suppressing melatonin production [SLEEP_002].\n\nImplementing these strategies may help improve your sleep.",
